## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) - CSS framework

### What I learned

In this project, I use Tailwind CSS as a tool to make my work easier and at the same time learn to apply Tailwind to real projects.

When working with Tailwind, I use **"Theme variables"** which allow me to create custom values ​​based on what I want. For example, I can add a new font to my project by defining a theme variable like `--font-display`:

```css
@theme {
    --font-display: "Red Hat Display", sans-serif;
}
```

```html
<div class="font-display ..."></div>
```

### Continued development

In the future, I'd like to master Tailwind CSS, as I'm currently learning it and using it in this project. I'm excited to continue learning more about it and improving my skills.
